<h2>Codask - an educational platform for the students, <br/>graduates, and mentors of Code Academy Berlin</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Collaborative project developed by Helene Abi Assi, Rafał Zajac, and Thair Orfali, as the final web development project from their boot camp at Code Academy Berlin, using Git and Github. 

<strong>Codask</strong> is an educational platform and student community for web development and data analytics students, graduates, and mentors from Code Academy Berlin. 
With this app, users can sign up and complete their profiles, create posts related to their projects and sprints, and search for existing solutions, by filtering the questions by tags, modules, or other criteria. </p>

<h3>Functionalitites and objectives of the application:</h3>

<p>After creating an account, users can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask questions about the projects and apps they are working on. The “Ask a Question” form also allows users to post code snippets, using a rich text editor, link it to their Github repo, and add category tags.</li>
  <li>Once a question is submitted, it appears in the user's profile under the 'Your Questions' section. Users can also edit and delete the questions they submitted. </li>
    <li>Search for questions that are already posted, with the ability to filter questions by tags and modules. Users can also search by keyword or category using the search bar. </li>
    <li>Search for tags and subsequently be able to filter questions by the tag they selected. The Tag page allows users to search for tags via a search bar, by course type, or other filter criteria. You can also bookmark a tag and save it in your profile.</li>
  <li>Search for modules and subsequently be able to filter questions by the module selected.</li>
</ul>  

Users can view detailed pages of each question, and vote up or down the answers. Once a user considers their questions solved by one of the answers submitted, they can change its status to 'Solved'.
They also have access to their profile, where can will see questions asked, contributions, and saved tags. 

Additionally, we wanted to cultivate the Codac spirit into our app by adding a section where students can post their student projects, including the repo and deployment link, as a source of inspiration to newer students. 
<br/>Users can participate in polls (another Codac tradition) and can vote on all open polls. 
They can also use our Connect page to look for students, graduates, or mentors and get in touch with them for collaborations.
