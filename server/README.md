# Codask server

The Codask server is a NestJS API backed by MongoDB and Mongoose. It provides
authentication and user, question, answer and tag endpoints for the
[client](../client/README.md). Swagger documentation is available at `/docs`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.12 or newer and npm. The frontend's current Vite dependency also
  supports Node.js 20.19 or newer within the 20.x release line.
- Docker and Docker Compose to run the local MongoDB service, or another
  reachable MongoDB instance with a separate development database.

## Local setup

From `server/`, install dependencies and create a local `.env` file:

```bash
npm ci
```

For example, use the following as a starting point for the Compose MongoDB
service when running the server on the host:

```dotenv
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/codask-dev
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=replace-with-a-unique-local-secret
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=15m
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=replace-with-a-different-unique-local-secret
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=7d
```

Replace the example secrets with distinct local values. Do not commit `.env`,
use production credentials, or point tests at production data.
The file is local to your machine, so each contributor must configure it.
Before starting the server on the host, verify its active `MONGO_URI` points to
the intended local database.

Start just the database from the repository root before starting the API:

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait mongo
```

MongoDB listens on `127.0.0.1:27017` on the host. A new database is empty;
its named volume retains existing data and no sample data is loaded
automatically. To add synthetic sample data, run `npm run seed:dev` from
`server/` after starting MongoDB.

The seed command always targets `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/codask-dev`, ignoring
`MONGO_URI` and other environment settings. Ensure the intended local Compose
MongoDB instance owns that port before running it. It inserts missing sample
records without changing existing fixture records or deleting any data. If a
fixture ID belongs to an unrelated record, it fails rather than overwriting it.
Errors such as a conflicting unique email may leave some records inserted; fix
the conflict and rerun. The synthetic user accounts cannot log in.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | API listening port. Required by startup validation. |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection URI. Required by startup validation. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed browser origins, comma-separated without spaces. Required by startup validation. |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` | Separate signing secrets for access and refresh tokens. Needed for authentication. |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY` | Token lifetimes, such as `15m` and `7d`. Used when signing tokens. |
| `DOMAIN_NAME` | Optional cookie domain. Omit for host-only cookies in local development. |

The startup schema explicitly validates `PORT`, `MONGO_URI` and
`CORS_ORIGINS`; configure the token values as well to use authentication.
Origins must match the browser's client origin, including its port.

Start the API:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

With the example configuration, the API is at <http://localhost:5000> and
Swagger UI is at <http://localhost:5000/docs>. Start the
[client](../client/README.md#local-setup) separately.

### Authentication and local cookies

The API sets access and refresh tokens as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`
cookies. Browser handling of secure cookies over HTTP depends on the host and
browser; arbitrary HTTP hosts may not work. Ensure the API URL, allowed origin
and optional cookie domain are consistent when diagnosing login or refresh
issues. Avoid setting a production cookie domain for local development.

## Commands

Run from `server/`:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run start:dev` | Start the API in watch mode. |
| `npm run start` | Start the API without watch mode. |
| `npm run build` | Compile the application into `dist/`. |
| `npm run start:prod` | Run the compiled application; build first. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint with `--fix`; this can modify files. |
| `npm run format` | Run Prettier with `--write`; this can modify files. |
| `npm run seed:dev` | Add missing synthetic records to the local development database. |
| `npm test` | Run the Jest unit tests. |
| `npm run test:cov` | Run unit tests with coverage and the configured 70% global thresholds. |
| `npm run test:integration` | Run integration tests inside the Docker test runner. |
| `npm run test:all` | Run unit and integration tests inside the Docker test runner. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run the separate e2e suite; see the caveat below. |

The existing e2e test imports the full app and requires a configured, reachable
MongoDB instance. It currently expects an outdated root response (`Hello
World!`), so it needs updating before it can reliably pass. Use a separate test
database and test credentials; do not use production resources.

### Docker test runner

From the repository root, run both unit and integration tests:

```bash
docker compose -p codask-tests -f docker-compose.test.yaml run --build --rm test
```

This builds the test image, starts a separate test MongoDB and waits for it to
be healthy. No host Node.js installation or `server/.env` file is needed.
The image contains the source and dependencies, so use `--build` after changes.

Run the suites individually:

```bash
# Unit tests only; does not start MongoDB
docker compose -p codask-tests -f docker-compose.test.yaml run --build --rm --no-deps test npm test -- --ci --runInBand

# Integration tests only
docker compose -p codask-tests -f docker-compose.test.yaml run --build --rm test npm run test:integration -- --ci --runInBand
```

Unit tests can also still run in the running application server with
`docker compose exec server npm test`. Integration tests run only in the
dedicated test runner: they connect to `mongo-test:27017`, ignore `MONGO_URI`,
seed a uniquely named database with the shared fixtures, and remove it during
teardown. They never seed the development database; `seed:dev` remains optional
and manual.

The test MongoDB has no published host port and stores its data in memory.
The test runner is removed automatically, but the MongoDB container remains
available for subsequent runs. Stop and remove the test stack when finished:

```bash
docker compose -p codask-tests -f docker-compose.test.yaml down
```

GitHub Actions uses the same test stack and cleans it up after the tests. The
existing e2e command does not automatically connect to this service; do not run
it against development or production data.

## Source layout

- `src/auth/` and `src/user/`: authentication and users.
- `src/question/`, `src/answer/` and `src/tag/`: domain endpoints and services.
- `src/config/` and `src/common/`: configuration and shared utilities.
- `src/main.ts`: HTTP bootstrap, Swagger setup and Lambda handler.
- `src/**/*.spec.ts`: Jest unit tests; `src/**/*.integration-spec.ts`: integration tests.
- `test/`: shared fixtures and separate Jest configuration and e2e test.

## Docker Compose

After creating `server/.env`, run from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Compose starts MongoDB, the server and the client. The server waits for MongoDB
to become healthy and uses `mongodb://mongo:27017/codask-dev` inside the
Compose network, overriding `MONGO_URI` from `server/.env`. A server started
on the host instead uses the active URI in its environment or `.env`.

The database uses a named volume, so its data survives normal container restarts
and `docker compose down`. Removing the volume deletes the local data. MongoDB
has no authentication and is intended only for local development; its host
port is bound to loopback, but other local users can still access it. Do not
expose it publicly or use it for production.

Compose maps the server's port 5000 to the host. Set `PORT=5000` for that
mapping, or update the mapping if you use another port. Ensure `CORS_ORIGINS`
matches the client URL opened in the browser.

## Deployment

On pushes to `main`, the
[backend deployment workflow](../.github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml) installs
dependencies, runs unit and integration tests in Docker and builds before deploying to
AWS Lambda and creating an API Gateway deployment. A test failure stops the
deployment. The integration tests use an isolated, ephemeral MongoDB service;
the workflow does not run e2e tests or enforce coverage thresholds. It builds
with Node 24 and configures the Lambda runtime as Node 22.
