Cloudinary & NextJS

Considerations:
--if using SSR, we need to consider if we want image optimization and transformations to happen on client-side or server-side
Next.js allows for SSR, which means some rendering occurs on the server before sending HTML to the client. When dealing with Cloudinary in SSR, you might pre-render images on the server using Cloudinary's API or transformations. For this, you'd want to use the Cloudinary Node.js SDK within your Next.js server-side code to fetch optimized images and include them in the initial HTML response.

--we can create custom image components for optimization that can handle handle transformations, lazy loading, and responsive images
--Next.js provides serverless functions (API routes) that can be used to interact with Cloudinary's APIs. You might utilize these routes to handle image uploads, transformations, or any server-side tasks related to Cloudinary.

<!-- const CloudinaryImage = ({ publicId, width, height, alt }) => {
  return (
    <Image
      cloudName="your_cloud_name"
      publicId={publicId}
      width={width}
      height={height}
      alt={alt}
    />
  );
}; -->

--For SSR, ensure that the Cloudinary integration on the server doesnâ€™t interfere with hydration on the client side.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Ensure that any server-side logic related to Cloudinary (like fetching or transforming images) doesn't cause issues during the hydration process on the client side. You might need to conditionally execute Cloudinary-related code in getServerSideProps or getInitialProps methods to prevent re-fetching or reprocessing on the client side.

Client Hydration: For components that fetch or interact with Cloudinary on the client side after initial render, use lifecycle methods (if using class components) or useEffect hooks (if using functional components) to manage Cloudinary-related operations. Make sure to handle any cleanup to avoid memory leaks or unexpected behavior during client-side rendering.
